# Venn Diagram Generator

simple web application that allows users to generate Venn diagrams, with all possible combinations of set intersections. (full coverage venn diagram)

## Files Overview
- `index.html` - The main structure of the webpage
- `styles.css` - Styling for the application, including dark mode
- `script.js` - JavaScript logic to update the Venn diagram dynamically

## How the Diagram Generation Works
1. The number of sets is taken as user input.
2. The `script.js` file generates SVG elements corresponding to the specified number of sets.
3. The diagram dynamically updates when the input value changes, recalculating all intersections in real time.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter the desired number of sets in the input field.
3. Observe the dynamically updated Venn diagram with all possible intersections.
